Station Setup
=============

The station has several core components:

* The control computer.
* The spectrometer (and associated optics).
* The motor.
* GPS.
* Power control.
* Communication.

Spectrometer
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Open |SO2| station is designed to work with an Ocean Optics USB spectrometer. The spectrometer is controlled through a Python library called Python Seabreeze, which is maintained on GitHub `here <https://github.com/ap--/python-seabreeze>`_ .

The spectrometer is connected to the Raspberry Pi by a USB cable which provides power and control.

Stepper Motor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The scanner head is rotated using a stepper motor controlled by the Raspberry Pi. The motor requires a separate control board to operate with a separate power supply. 

The Open |SO2| scanner uses a board called the `Adafruit Motor HAT. <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348>`_ to control the stepper motor. Details can be found in the Adafruit documentation. To operate the HAT Adafruit Blinka must first be installed::
	
	pip install -upgrade setuptools
	
Next enable I2C and SPI and reboot. Then run the following commands::

	pip install RPI.GPIO
	pip install adafruit-blinka
	
Then install the circuit python library for motor control::

	pip install adafruit-circuitpython-motorkit
